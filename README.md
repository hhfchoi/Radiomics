# Radiomics
Radiomics research with NSCLC dataset from TCIA

Started as a Capstone project for the BrainStation Data Science diploma program

The .csv files are generated from combining the table files as a result of running the Radiomics module in Slicer
- the agg is obtained from aggregating all tumours into one mask
- the csv without agg is with all tumours processed separately, then zero padded to the maximum number of tumours
